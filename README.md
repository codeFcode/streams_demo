# streams_demo
This is a small demo on Iota Streams (https://www.iota.org/solutions/streams) : a client written in rust that consume http rest services (thanks to https://github.com/nareph/channel-server) to create a stream, add messages, read the last message and messages history.

2- Launch the server:  https://github.com/nareph/channel-server  
3- Compile and run!  $ cargo run
